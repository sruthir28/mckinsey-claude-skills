name: scpr-framework
description: SCPR (Situation-Complication-Problem-Recommendation) framework for structured problem solving and executive communication. Use when users need to structure strategic arguments, analyze business situations, create executive summaries, or develop clear problem statements using McKinsey-style communication. Apply when structuring recommendations, writing memos, or organizing strategic thinking.

SCPR Framework
A structured approach to problem-solving and executive communication used in management consulting.
Framework Components
S - Situation: Current state of the market/business

What is the lay of the land?
Establish baseline context
Describe the stable environment before changes

C - Complication: Recent shift or change

What has changed recently?
New market dynamics (AI boom, regulatory changes, competitive threats)
The catalyst that creates urgency

P - Problem: Crisp question to solve

What specific strategic question must be answered?
Common examples: "How to grow revenue?", "How to enter new market?", "How to reduce costs?"
Must be specific and answerable

R - Recommendation: Proposed actions

What should be done and by when?
Priority actions to address the problem
Can be structured as issue tree branches (doesn't have to be only high-priority items)
Specific, actionable, time-bound

Core Principles
MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)

Recommendations should not overlap
Together they should cover all necessary actions
Each recommendation addresses distinct aspect of the problem

Clarity

Each section should be concise
Problem statement must be answerable
Recommendations must be actionable

Example: Tech Startup Product Pivot
Situation
Series B SaaS startup with $15M ARR selling project management software to creative agencies and marketing firms. Product focuses on task management, resource allocation, and client collaboration. 200 agency customers with average contract size $75K. Historically strong product-market fit with 25% YoY growth and 90% gross retention.
Complication
AI-powered tools like ChatGPT, Notion AI, and Claude emerging as workflow automation alternatives. Customer usage metrics declining 15% over last 6 months. Exit interviews reveal agencies using AI for project briefs, status updates, and resource planning - core features of current product. Three enterprise deals ($500K pipeline) paused citing "evaluating AI-first solutions."
Problem
How should we reposition the product and business model to return to 25%+ growth within 12 months while competing against general-purpose AI tools?
Recommendations

Product: Launch AI-native workflow engine by Q2 2025

Integrate LLM for automated project scoping and task breakdown
AI-powered resource matching based on skills and availability
Differentiate on agency-specific context (brand guidelines, client history, creative workflows)


Positioning: Shift from "project management" to "AI-augmented agency operations" by Q1 2025

Rebrand messaging around AI that understands agency workflows
Emphasize integration advantages over general tools
Target gap: ChatGPT lacks agency-specific memory and processes


Pricing: Introduce usage-based AI tier by Q2 2025

Base platform remains flat fee ($75K)
AI features charged per automation/generation
Capture value from high-usage customers, protect downside



Usage Patterns
When creating SCPR structure:

Start with Situation (establish baseline)
Identify Complication (what changed?)
Frame Problem as specific question
Develop MECE Recommendations with timeline

When analyzing existing content:

Extract facts into S/C/P/R categories
Test Problem for specificity
Verify Recommendations are MECE
Add timelines if missing

When reviewing SCPR:

Is Situation necessary context only (not exhaustive)?
Is Complication recent and urgent?
Is Problem answerable and specific?
Are Recommendations mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive?
Does each Recommendation include "by when"?

Common Mistakes to Avoid

Situation too detailed: Keep to essential context only
Complication = Problem: They're different. Complication is "what changed", Problem is "what question to solve"
Vague Problem: "Improve business" is too broad. "Increase revenue 40% in 12 months" is specific
Overlapping Recommendations: Ensure MECE structure
No timelines: Always include "by when" in Recommendations
